1.) Concurrent read with the commited value and exculsive writes with locks
2.) Example 1: Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
3.) Example 2: Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

4.)You have a set of tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.  
Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.


Example 1:

Input: "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
Example 2:

Input: "AAABBC"
Output: 188
 

Note:

1 <= tiles.length <= 7
tiles consists of uppercase English letters.

5.) Given an integer array find the max median for K iterations
For example : 1 , 2, 5, 3, 5 K = 2 Max median = 5
