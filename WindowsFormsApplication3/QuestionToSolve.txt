1.) Given input array in sorted order with array rotation like the below
Input array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 8 , 1, 2] given 
target = 1 find the index of 1 in the given array , output should be 5
target = 7 find the index of 1 in the given array , output should be -1
target = 4 find the index of 1 in the given array , output should be 1

2.) Concurrent read with the commited value and exculsive writes with locks
3.) Given input of string abc, generate the permutation like abc, acb, bac, bca, cab,cba etc
4.) Example 1: Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
5.) Example 2: Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
