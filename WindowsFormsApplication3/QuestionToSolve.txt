1.) Concurrent read with the commited value and exculsive writes with locks
2.) Example 1: Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
3.) Example 2: Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

4.)You have a set of tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.  
Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.


Example 1:

Input: "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
Example 2:

Input: "AAABBC"
Output: 188
 

Note:

1 <= tiles.length <= 7
tiles consists of uppercase English letters.

5.) Given an integer array find the max median for K iterations
For example : 1 , 2, 5, 3, 5 K = 2 Max median = 5

6.) Given a binary tree and an integer value 12 delete the nodes which are smaller than the given integer value 12. For example 
6 will be deleted 4 is not deleted since 20 which is child on 4 which smaller than given integer value should not be deleted.

						    10
					   /         \  
                      /			  \
					 4			  15	
					/ \			 /	
                   /   \		/
				  6    20     1
					 

7.) Find the longest path in  binary tree
8.) Given a pair of groups merge the group which matches X and Y. 
	
		[1,3]
		[6,8]
		[10, 12]
		[8,3]
		
For example  
		[1, 3] 
		[6, 8] --> Is not matching with previous group so inserting as a new group
		[10 ,12 ] --> Is not matching with previous group so inserting as a new group
		[8,3]  --> 8 is present in [ 6, 8] and 3 is matching with [1,3], so this can be grouped into one [1, 3, 6 , 8] so now we have only 2  groups below and output that

		[1,3,6, 8]
		[10, 12]
