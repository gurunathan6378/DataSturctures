1.) Concurrent read with the commited value and exculsive writes with locks
2.)You have a set of tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.  
Return the nu mber of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.

Example 1:

Input: "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
Example 2:

Input: "AAABBC"
Output: 188
 

Note:

1 <= tiles.length <= 7
tiles consists of uppercase English letters.

5.) Given an integer array find the max median for K iterations
For example : 1 , 2, 5, 3, 5 K = 2 Max median = 5

				 

7.) Find the longest path in  binary tree
8.) Given a pair of groups merge the group which matches X and Y. 
	
		[1,3]
		[6,8]
		[10, 12]
		[8,3]
		
For example  
		[1, 3] 
		[6, 8] --> Is not matching with previous group so inserting as a new group
		[10 ,12 ] --> Is not matching with previous group so inserting as a new group
		[8,3]  --> 8 is present in [ 6, 8] and 3 is matching with [1,3], so this can be grouped into one [1, 3, 6 , 8] so now we have only 2  groups below and output that

		[1,3,6, 8]
		[10, 12]


9.) There are N coins, each showing either heads or tails. We would like all the coins to 
form a sequence of alternating heads and tails. What is the minimum number of coins 
that must be reversed to achieve this? 

Write a function: 
class Solution
{
	public int solution(int[] A); 
} 

that, given an array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the minimum number of coins that must be reversed. Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins and contain either a 0 (heads) or a 1 (tails). 

Examples: 
1. Given array A = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], the function should return 1. After reversing the sixth coin, we achieve an alternating sequence of coins 
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. 

2. Given array A = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], the function should return 2. After reversing the first and fifth coins, we achieve an alternating sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 . 

3. Given array A = [0, 1, 0], the function should return 0. The sequence of coins is already alternating. 
. Given array A = [0, 1, 1, 0], the function should return 2. We can reverse the first and second coins to get the sequence: [1, 0, 1, 0]. 

A ssume that: 
• N is an integer within the range [1..100]; 
• each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1. 

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of our solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
